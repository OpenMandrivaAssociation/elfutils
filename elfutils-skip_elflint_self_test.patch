don't fail on failures of run-elflinut-self. it's a grey area. the gnu toolchain
produces binaries which are not necessary compliant with elf docs and finding who's
wrong is not evident (at least for me)

On mips, it doesn't like :
.dynsym:
    94: 00434730  1388 FUNC    GLOBAL HIDDEN    11 __udivdi3

STT_OTHER STV_HIDDEN STB_GLOBAL doesn't seem to be a valid combo according to
elf docs but mips toolchain creates it

On arm, it doesn't like :
.dynsym:
     2: 0004aaec     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS __exidx_start

I guess this has been introduced by binutils commit 83090d51cd2267390612f7bccbfd586d7fbec39f
The information about where to put __exidx_start is not easy to find and it's really possible
that elflint is right here too
